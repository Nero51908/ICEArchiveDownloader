Modify the dictionary variable called payload like you are logging in to ICE@XJTLU.

The script will try to download all coursework you have uploaded to ICE@XJTLU(2017/18) which is an archive site now.

Downloaded files are stored in your python working directory (they goes where you called the script. )

There could be mistery bugs in this script, be careful if you decide to give it a run.

This script might not be maintained because I did this for my laziness in clicking every download link.

Why I have to click every download link? Because, I have f**kin lost all my coursework files after a wrong rsyn call.

Have a nice day.And wish you a productive and happy new year.
